This tutorial gives you a brief introduction to molecular simulation of the biomembranes with Gromacs using shell programming. In this examples we perform molecular dynamics simulation of POPC lipid bilayer at different temperatures. Execution of burn_bilayer.sh script on the local Linux machine will replicate the bilayer system to perform simulation of each replica at different temperature. Depending on your scientific creativity you can adapt this tutorial for any of your molecular systems. 

TODO: python version of the script will be added.
