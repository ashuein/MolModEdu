	This is a bash script that can be used as introduction to molecular dynamics simulations of biomembrane systems with GROMACS. This tutorial gives you a brief introduction to molecular simulation of the biomembranes with Gromacs using shell programming. In this examples you can perform molecular modeling of POPC lipid bilayer solvated in water at different temperature. Execution of burn_bilayer.sh script on the local Linux machine will create the output folder with simulations. This folder will be sent on multi-CPU server for the calculations (see details within the script). Depending on your scientific creativity you can easily vary or add additional physical parameters of the simulations with Gromacs. As the exercise you can apply pressure to the system to compres bilayer (see the example in my repository). Finally it is also possible to adapt this tutorial for your molecular systems (water-soluble protein). 

TODO: the script for the analysis of the system will be available soon. You will be able to compare physical behaviour of the lipids and water under different heating.

TODO: python version of the script will be added (one day).
