	This is bash script, which can be used as introduction to molecular dynamics simulations of biomembrane systems with GROMACS as well as in form of the tutorial of shell scripting applied for computational biophysics. simulations of biomembrane system at different physical conditions.  In this examples you can perform molecular modeling of POPC lipid bilayer in GROMACS at different temperature (burn_bilayer.sh). Execution of burn_bilayer.sh script on the local Linux machine will create the output folder with simulations. This folder will be sent on multi-CPU server for calculations. Depending on your scientific creativity you can easily vary additional physical parameters of the simulations with Gromacs. As the exercise you can apply pressure to the system to compres bilayer (see the example in my repository). Finally it is also possible to adapt this tutorial for your molecular systems. 

TODO: the script for the analysis of the system will be available soon. You will be able to compare physical behaviour of the lipids and water under different heating.
